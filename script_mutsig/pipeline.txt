Pipeline





1. Run slideJ to crop images into many blocks (window, patches)





2. Color deconvolution


Double check which deconvolution option is the best


Here I use [H DAB] - the best to separate membrane from nucleus and marker staining image


But for different images, maybe we need to select different deconvolution option





3. Nucleus segmentation


Attention: at the boundary of image, right side, there are some problem due to capturing process, we need to open image and remove these parts first.





4. Other process ..pending
